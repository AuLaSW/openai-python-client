# openai-python-client

A python GUI application that communicates with OpenAI through their openai-python API. Works with OpenAI Text Completion and Text Edit models.

## Purpose

I began developing this program in January of 2023 as a tool for people in my circle to interact with different ChatGPT models. The goal was to use the OpenAI API to develop an application that could run on the desktop and communicate with the ChatGPT servers. 

Accessing the servers needed to be general use so they could fit the tool to their needs. It also needed to be easy to use, so no needing to download and build from source. It needed to be as general-purpose and accessible as possible.

Though those aspects are not yet developed/ready, in the future the application will have a GUI and have a binary release for Windows (with releases for other OS's coming as fast as I can get them).

This project is still a work in progress, though I am working on it frequently right now.
